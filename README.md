# Carvify

I want four modifications. First, is it better to use `pytsk3` for accessing the disk image file so to be able to handle more formats? If yes, apply it and make the necessary changes. Second, I want the program to list all the files that found so the user can then specify which file wants to extract. Third, is it possible to list the available disks/particions for extraction so the user finds it more easy to choose? Finally, can you add when the program is invoked the name of the program and the credits with ascii art?
